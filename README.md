This repository contains the implementation of all experiments presented in the paper.

Comparison models — Each folder or script is named after the corresponding model.

Ablation studies — Code is organized according to the section titles in the paper, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence.

Data and trained models — The complete dataset and pre-trained models are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/shiinazhao/paper-repository/tree/main
.

The final model adopted in this paper, SBERT-LDA, is equivalent to the model with parameter setting 6_83 in Section 4.3. Therefore, the corresponding model files and results are also stored in data/4-3/6_83.
